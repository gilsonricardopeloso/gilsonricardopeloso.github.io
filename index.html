					Hello, I'm an electrical engineer with a specialization in education (IT).
					<br />
					My goal is to create solutions to real problems reliably and efficiently.
					With a focus on programming, I try to work in all stages of the development of
					complex systems and applications for different platforms.
					<br />
					In the last 4 years, I've been working as a Tech Lead <a href="#ref-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>,
					being responsible for the technical quality of the project, implementing complex solutions
					and ensuring the excellence of deliveries. But, most importantly, I've been resuming my work of training new
					developers
					who join our team.
					<br />
					My Tech Stack <a href="#ref-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> is quite varied with NodeJS, NestJS, NextJS, React, React
					Native, Vue3, Angular, C#,
					Java, Spring Boot, PHP, Python, Magento2, Delphi (FireMonkey). Dev Ops platforms: GitHub, Bitbucket, Azure
					DevOps,
					GitLab.
					Lately, I've been focusing on the full (Java|Type)Script stack.
					<br />
					When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me spending time with my family, cooking, helping my kids with any
					homework or school
					projects, doing any housework around the house or on the farm, studying, listening to good music, reading a
					book, meeting with friends, etc..
					<br />
				</p>
				<h2>Projects</h2>
				<p>Some of my notable (past or present) side projects.</p>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="bold">kitWeb</span> - KitWEB is our all-in-one backend, ie, the code that runs on the server,
						which receives requests from clients, and
						contains the logic to send the appropriate data back to the client. The backend also includes the database,
						which will
						persistently store all of the app's data.
					</li>
					<li><span class="bold">kitFarm</span> - kitFarm's all-in-one farm management software lets you focus on your
						passion, from record keeping to task management,
						planning to growth tracking, harvests to sales, kitFarm delivers an end-to-end solution to help you manage
						every part of
						your farm business.
					</li>
					<li><span class="bold">kitSAM</span> - kitSAM was purpose-built for maintenance, reliability, and operations
						teams.
						Work orders, inventory, and full asset life cycle information are at your fingertips.
					</li>
					<li><span class="bold">WebxNet</span> - Internet solutions Webxnet provides
						a code intended to be a functional replacement for the landing page, but without all the slowdowns and
						memory bloat.
						(Written in NodeJS and NextJS). Development is currently on hold.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
